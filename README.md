# Flask REST API First Project üíª

This project was designed to test my knowledge in these libraries and frameworks.
Doing a CRUD in a network of stores, with different items, that can be included, updated or deleted, also with tags, that are related with the stores.
Also using JWT to user athentification, for more secure requests

## What was used ‚å®Ô∏è

* Flask;
* Docker; 
* Flask-Smorest; 
* SQLAlchemy; 

## How to Test It üñ•Ô∏è

- You will need a tool like Insomnia, to send requests to the API.
- The URL to send the requests is : (https://rest-api-flask-python-project-21bq.onrender.com)
- Replace the (url), with the url provided to test it properly.
- Replace the (id) with the generated id from previous requests.
- The first request may take a while (approximately 20 seconds), since the docker image is hosted in a free plan in render.com
